## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit).

- As an international student, I want to get to know more about Bristolâ€™s different neighbourhoods' crime history. So that I can choose the safest place I should stay in during my studying period to avoid risks. I want to stay away from danger and feel like home during my residence in Bristol.

- As a UK Home Student, I want to know if the place I am living at is the safest place to live by knowing the history of the place. The place of study should not distract or put me in danger during my time being there. I want something that will display the neighbourhood's past and in what area of Bristol I should avoid. This should benefit me by letting me use a tool for such a use. 

- As a new resident moving to Bristol for a new workplace, I want to search for the safest place to stay in Bristol. So that I can be in a convenient environment and go to my work safely.

- As a resident, I want to report an incedent or a crime I have experienced in my neighbourhood, so that I can spread conscious and get engaged to spread crime awareness to my community.

- As a researcher, I want a reliable website that provides statistical data for Bristol's neighbourhoods' crimes history, so that I can benefit from it in my research about crimes in Bristol.  



### Actors
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product.

-	International students: We focus mainly on international students who come from their home countries and search for accommodation to stay in during their period of studying. They will need to be provided with information about the place/ neighbourhood they intend to go to.
-	Second, third year students and postgraduates: they will not be in the university halls so they will need a place to stay. This tool will be helpful for safety reasons.
-	New residents (families or individuals): As they are moving to a new different city (Bristol), they need to seek the safest places to live in.
-	Neighbours: Neighbours are given the chance to show the different types of crimes that can be shown, can be reported. 
-	Researchers and Criminology enthusiasts: this is a tool to show data, anyone can go on the website out of curiosity. Researchers can be involved on the website for their studies.
-	(Theoretically) police: they can see what areas will need to be worked on to make these areas safer.


### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (at least one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
TODO: create a list of functional requirements. 
e.g. "The system shall ..."
    Give each functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. FR1, FR2, ...
    Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.
    
FR1: The system MUST allow users to search for specific neighborhoods in Bristol by name on a map. (Search Functionality) (UC1) <br> FR2: The system SHOULD provide filters to narrow down data by time range (e.g., last month, last year) and type of crime (e.g., theft, assault). (UC1) <br> FR3: The system MUST get the crimes data from crimes dataset used from Bristol Open Data. (UC1) <br> FR4: The system COULD provide real-time updates on ongoing crimes depending on resource limitations and data availability constraints. (UC1) <br> FR5: The system WON'T allow direct interaction with police systems or data submission due to legal and technical complexities. (UC1) (UC2) <br> FR6: The system MUST allow users to report incidents and new crimes. (UC2). <br> FR7: The system COULD update the crime data based on user reports. (UC2). <br> FR8: The system SHOULD ensure data accuracy and reliability. (UC1) (UC2). <br> FR9: 




### Non-Functional Requirements
TODO: Consider one or more [quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126) to suggest a small number of non-functional requirements.
