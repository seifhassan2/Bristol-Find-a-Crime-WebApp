# Project Proposal 

Bristol's Find a Crime 

  ## Business Case 

  
  ### Problem statement 

 Bristol citizens may be often unaware of criminal activities in their neighbourhoods, and many individuals are unaware of potential safety threats. Without an easy way to access clear crime information, residents struggle to respond to and prevent crime effectively. 
Most importantly, international students that come from various parts of the world to study in Bristol need to be more convenient about their new place as it will be their new home during their period of studying. They will need some source to review the crime history of the area which they are choosing.  
Additionally, people who intend to move to Bristol. They need to know more about their new neighbourhood before moving there. A solution is needed to close this information gap and improve public safety. 
Thus, our webapp aims to show the crime rates in different neighbourhoods around Bristol.   

  
### Business benefits 

TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide. 

Our objects are to: 

1- Provide crime data of different neighbourhoods around Bristol.  

2- Enhance safety awareness for those who live or going to live in high-rate crime areas. 

3- Encourage residents to report incidents and safety issues.

4- Establishing the app as a reliable sources of crime data which makes it trusted. 

5- The use of the app can help with scalability meaning that the app can go on to different markets or communities to help them with their needs.

6- The app will help with the social impact which will incentive communities to tackle down crime.

  

### Options Considered 

TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs? 

  
Some apps like UK Police Crime Map, Spot Crime and Crime Reports have the same idea and provide the same services, but our app will be different as it mainly focuses on Bristol's different neighbourhoods, which would be specific for people living in Bristol, moving to Bristol or even international students studying in Bristol.  
Moreover, its aim is to display statistics for different neighbourhoods in Bristol to let the user know the percentage of crime risks for the area he searches for.  
The user will just need to search for the crime type, year, and the crime type such as theft or assault.  

 
### Expected Risks 

TODO: What are the main risks of this project? 
  

1- Unreliable data might be used for the app and it will be perceived as unreliable itself. Meaning that the public will not have the reason nor the trust to use it. 

2- The level of attraction to the app will not be high enough and the app will fail a result. the lack of care or bugs will make it seem unattractive 

3- The app being used will experience downtime. which means that the reductions in accuracy will be fed into the app.  

4- App with better technology could overtake the use of the app being used. the changes in technology would mean our app will need to be up to date. 

5- The appâ€™s data set we are using is from 2016-2023, which means that the user will not be able to view the crime history after that period. (Unless the data set is updated). 

6- The features of this app may or may be available due to the experience of the developer's skill in the field. Additionally, the developer will not have financial means to develop the more advanced features. 

  

## Project Scope 

TODO: Scope of the System of Interest. Include a bullet list of things from your context diagram that are in scope. 

The aim of the project is to make a chart or something similar regarding the trends of previous crimes in Bristol.  
The aim is to show statistics from Bristol's from certain areas that will be coloured coded to show the severity of the crime. This will give people a chance to see what has happened in the last 7-8 years. 
The main function of the website is to make it customizable with different options. Time, location and crime type will all serve a purpose with the map, and it gives it a chance for the stakeholders (theoretically police), students (especially international), and the people living there) will have the capacity to look at the crime with their own use. 
More to add on if that past crimes will be seen with and statistics (without the numbers, the map is considered useless).  

  
Elements from the context diagram. 

1- Stakeholders: Bristol's current residents, people moving to Bristol, International students looking for accommodation in Bristol. All of them might be involved 

2- Tech Used: HTML, CSS, and JS / Google Maps 

3- Database used: Bristol open data 

4- Depends on maps and statistics
