# Project Proposal
Bristol'S Find a Crime

## Business Case

### Problem statement
 Bristol citizens may be often unaware of criminal activities in their neighborhoods and many individuals are unware of potential safety threats.
  Without an easy way to access clear crime information, residents struggle to respond to and prevent crime effectively. Most importantly, international students that come from various parts of the world to study in Bristol, they need to be more covenient about their new place as it will be their new home during their period of studying. They will need some source to review the crime history of the area which they are choosing.
   Additionally, people who intend to move to Bristol. They need to know more about their new neighbourhood before moving there. 
    A solution is needed to close this information gap and improve public safety. Thus, our webapp aims to show the crime rates in differnet neighbourhoods around Bristol. 
  
 
### Business benefits
TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.

Our objects are to:
 
 1- provide crime data in different neighbourhoods around Bristol 
 2- Enhance safety awareness for those who live in high-rate crime areas
 3- Encourgae residents to report incidents and safety issues
 4- Establishing the app as a reliable sources of crime data which makes it trusted
 5- collaborating with customers can allow for the app to evolve to something better 
 6- The use of the app can help with scalability meaning that the app can go on to different markets or communities to help them with their needs
 7- The app will help with the social impact which will incentive communities to tackle down crime

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

Some apps like UK Police Crime Map, SpotCrime and CrimeReports have the same idea and provide the same services,
 but our app will be differnet as it focuses on Bristol's different neighbourhoods,
  which would be specific for people live in Bristol or moving in Bristol or even international students studying in Bristol.
Moreover, its aim is to display statistics for differnt neighbourhoods in Bristol in order to let the user know the percentage of crime risks for the area he searches for.
The user will just need to search for the crime type, year, and the crime type such as theft or assault.


### Expected Risks
TODO: What are the main risks of this project?

1- Unreliable data might be used for the app and it will be preceived as unreliable itself. meaning that the public will not have a reason nor the trust to use it
2- The level of attraction to the app will not be high enough and the app will fail a result. the lack of care or bugs will make it seem unattractive
3- If the infomation is wrong, the use of the app will have a bad reputatation and so will the community being used.
4- The infomation will need to be correct or at least show there is a crime being committed. 
5- The app being used will experience downtime. which means that the reductions in accuracy will be fed into the app. 
6- App with better technology could overtake the use of the app being used. the changes in technology would mean our app will need to be up to date.
